# Wittr
### Overview
This is a project I did to learn how to create a service worker and to create a PWA (Progressive Web App).
### Goal
Create an offline first PWA that uses a service worker to make sure the user has a much better experience when there isn't a data connection.
### Requirements
* Node.js
* NPM
### How to run the app
* [Clone](https://github.com/DavidHoffman80/Wittr.git) or [Download](https://github.com/DavidHoffman80/Wittr.git) the repository.
* In the terminal run `npm install` to install all of the projects dependencies.
* In the terminal run `npm run serve` to start the development server.
* In your favorite browser, enter `localhost:8888` into the address bar.
